      <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
      <p class="text-justify">Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a neurological disorder characterised by a build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain which causes the cerebral ventricles to become enlarged despite apparently normal CSF pressure at lumbar puncture. This results in a symptom triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive decline. I conducted research into the neruopsychological and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with NPH during my PHD at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge.</p>

          <p><h3>Neuropsychological outcome following shunt surgery</h3></p>
        <p class="text-justify">NPH is recognised as an important cause of cognitive decline as it may be reversible with treatment (e.g. with shunt surgery): while improvement following shunt surgery is most commonly observed in gait, there are reports of improvements in cognitive functions. This led to NPH being somewhat controversially described as a "reversible dementia". However, early studies of NPH did not examine cognitive symptoms in much detail. Only in more recent years has there been greater emphasis on quantifying cognitive outcome following using more detailed neuropsychological testing. In order to investigate neuropsychological outcome in NPH in more detail, I conducted a meta-analysis of previously published papers to investigate whether performance in a range of neuropsychological tests is improved following shunt surgery in patients with NPH. We found evidence to suggest that performance on these tests is improved, however, further research is needed to examine aspects of cognition, such as executive function, in more detail.
